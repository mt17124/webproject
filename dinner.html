        <p>This is such a flavorful, elegant salmon recipe that anyone can pull off. It's comes together so quickly yet it's sure to impress anyone. Pan seared salmon is perfectly delicious on it's own but when you add a bright dijon sauce like this it takes it to a whole new level! </p>
        <big>Pan Seared Salmon with Creamy Garlic Dijon Sauce</big>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <p> 1. 4 (6 - 7 oz) skinless salmon fillets</p>
        <p> 2. 3 tsp olive oil </p>
        <p> 3. Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p> 4. 3 garlic cloves, minced (1 Tbsp) </p>
        <p> 5. 1/2 tsp cornstarch</p>
        <p> 6. 1/2 cup heavy cream </p>
        <p> 7. 1 1/2 Tbsp dijon mustard (or a little more to taste) </p>
        <p> 8. 1/2 tsp honey </p>
        <p> 9. 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth  </p>
        <p> 10. 1 Tbsp minced fresh dill </p>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <p> 1. Heat a large non-stick skillets over medium-high heat (or use two skillets if you used large 7 - 8 oz fillets like I did so they aren't overcrowded).</p>
        <p> 2. Add 1 1/2 tsp olive oil to each skillet. Dab both sides of salmon dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. </p>
        <p> 3. Place salmon in skillet (top of salmon turned down). Let sear until golden brown on bottom, about 4 minutes then flip and continue to cook to desired doneness, about 2 - 3 minutes longer. </p>
        <p> 4.Meanwhile, in a liquid measuring cup whisk together cornstarch with 1 tbsp cream, then mix in enough cream to measure 1/2 cup. Whisk in dijon mustard and honey.</p>
        <p> 5.Remove salmon from skillet and transfer to a plate, leaving oil in one skillet. Tent salmon with foil. </p>
        <p> 6.Add garlic to skillet with oil set over medium heat, saute until just barely golden brown, about 20 - 30 seconds. Pour in chicken broth. </p>
        <p> 7.Bring to a simmer then reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until reduced by about 2/3, about 3 minutes. </p>
        <p> 8.Whisk cream mixture once more then pour into skillet. Cook and stir, bringing to a simmer. Let simmer gently, while stirring, for about 30 seconds. </p>
        <p> 9.Remove from heat stir in dill, return salmon fillets to pan, spoon sauce over salmon. Serve warm.</p>

          <p> Bansari love that with this recipe, you are throwing all of the ingredients into one pot. Everything goes into the Instant Pot and there's no sauteing beforehand.</p>
          <big>Instant Pot Creamy Tuscan Chicken Pasta<big>
          <p>Ingredients:</p>
          <p>1. 1 (32 oz) carton low-sodium chicken broth </p>
          <p>2. 1/2 cup oil packed sun dried tomatoes with herbs, drained and dab excess oil off with paper towels, chopped </p>
          <p>3. 2 tsp Italian seasoning </p>
          <p>4. 1 Tbsp minced garlic </p>
          <p>5. Salt and freshly ground black pepper </p>
          <p>6. 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes </p>
          <p>7. 12 oz uncooked campanelle pasta </p>
          <p>8. 5 oz fresh baby spinach </p>
          <p>9. 1 (8 oz) pkg. light cream cheese, cut into cubes and softened </p>
          <p>10. 1 cup finely shredded parmesan cheese (use fresh shredded) </p>
          <p>11. 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil </p>
          <p>Instructions:</p>
          <p>1. In an instant pot insert stir together broth, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, garlic, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper (season with more at the end if needed). </p>
          <p>2. Stir in chicken and pasta (and try to submerge down into broth). </p>
          <p>3.Secure the lid in place, be sure pressure valve is set to "sealing" position. Select the "manual" setting or high pressure and set to 5 minutes. </p>
          <p>4.After the time is up select "cancel" then use the quick release method to release pressure - which is to carefully turn the valve to "venting" position and step back as steam will release. </p>
          <p>5.Once it stops sputtering open lid and immediately stir noodles to separate then stir in spinach, light cream cheese and parmesan. </p>
          <p>6.Toss well. Let rest for about 5 - 10 minutes to thicken (it will seem like soup at first but as it rests and cools it will thicken right up). </p>
          <p>7.Toss in basil just before serving and serve warm (you can also garnish with a few diced sun dried tomatoes if desired). </p>
